What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you needd to do it?
	
	When a new git repository is initialized, a hidden file called .git is
	generated. It possibly contains all the metadata of the repository.
	It is necessory to do it because we want to indicate that it is a git
	repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think iy offers?

	It offers a control over what to commit and what not to commit at once.
	Before making a final commit it is better to upload it in the staging
	area and keep working on those files unitl its ready to commit.
